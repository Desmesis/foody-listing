# Foody Listing
Single Page Application to get the 10 nearest restaurants around your location

The information displayed for the restaurants are : Address, Phone Number, Distance (in meters), Rating and even a Link to Google maps, if you want to know your trajectory ! 

A "killer" feature would be a filtering feature that let's you choose a type of cuisine, the pricing or even if the restaurants are opened or not. Naturally, to add more filters is possible with an easy documentation :D

## Technologies :

This React App is coded in `Typescript`, with the use of MUI components for the styling. 
The API used is : `Google Places API Javascript`. 

## How to set it up : 

All the commands have to be done in the app repository, namely : front-app
You will have to do the following : 

- download or clone the repository
- `cd front-app`
- `npm install` to install the dependencies
- `npm start` to start the application on the default `localhost:3000`

You need to enable the geolocation on your navigator, because that's how the site knows where you are !

Have fun !
